There's mainstream with the main dreams
But waterfalls start with a little stream
Even Kubrick started with a small scene
Before it became "The Shining"

If you're coming from the hood, work on getting knowledge
If you're from the front line then you wanna survive
I didn't choose the battles but the battles chewin' me
From the bullet first hit my cousin Will C.

I been in the game now five point three
Lil shorty but got shorties after me
I stay humble 'cause the shit I seen
'Cause I already know there's only one me

I really would like see the star shine
But the life getting covered up in hard times
Ooh, I need to let loose and the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer

There's no means and there's no mean
Every tree started with a little bean
Everything you go through at 17
Will it still count at 70?

If I'm coming from the streets then I'm getting money
But my deeds in the bank are worth plenty
I didn't choose the music but the music chose me
The art of hitting your speakers, making it bleed

I've been thinking about what effects me
And the will to survive is always in me
Every glass of water grows what I be
And every glass of liquor gets me tipsy

I really would like see the star shine
But the life getting covered up in hard times
Ooh, I need to let loose and the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer

It's about people, not money
Light up a parliament, turn a car key
I could be a genius, I could be a cheat
It's a thin line and I'm fucking with it

I didn't choose a struggle but the struggle chose me
I'm dancing on the rubble permanently
I'm cut from the cloth that you made me
Driving down the alley, these cats know me

If it's not cool then we bring heat
If there's no heat then it's discrete
If it's got your feet then it's on me
Anything on me is God's got beat

I really would like see the star shine
But the life getting covered up in hard times
Ooh, I need to let loose and the water ran dry, fill it up with juice
Oh, they need a believer
