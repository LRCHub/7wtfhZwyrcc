Crawl under mighty refine
I know the door is the same as its high
That rather seems that can never be pulled
They're in your pocket, they'll never come out
Come ask, make you to get up
Throw off through a filthy believer
Come running, the fire will burn
So we can feel it
Run over mountain and break
There is a trip up and mistakes being made
And once you lean over things feel the same
They never look at good how they have changed
Come ask, make you to get up
Throw off through a filthy believer
Come running, the fire will burn
So we can feel it
Come ask, make you to get up
Throw off through a filthy believer
Come running, the fire will burn
So we can feel it
